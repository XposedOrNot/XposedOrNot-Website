			      <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@DevaOnBreaches" target="_blank" style="margin-left: 10px;"><i class="fab fa-mastodon "></i></a> ) and I bring over two decades of experience in IT and cybersecurity. My career has been dedicated to helping organizations fortify their online defenses and ensure they comply with industry standards. I'm skilled at crafting security strategies that work across the globe, whether it's technical or not.
                              <br><br>
			      Outside of work, I have a strong interest in forensic investigations and enjoy tackling challenges in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions. In 2017, I started a side project called XposedOrNot. It began as a way to collect and share exposed passwords for free. Over time, I've been gathering data from public breaches, and now, with a wealth of information at hand, I want to offer this resource to those who can benefit from it the most.<br><br>
			      My journey in IT and cybersecurity has been immensely fulfilling, and I'm committed to sharing my knowledge and expertise to create a safer digital world for all.

                              <strong>XposedOrNot (XON)</strong> is a practical and resourceful tool designed to enable you to verify 🔍 if your personal data has been implicated in a data breach. Originally, this initiative was born out of my deep interest in forensics and the analysis of data breaches. The realization of the sheer volume of sensitive information exposed and the potential harm it could cause quickly led me to transform this interest into a public service. I was motivated to offer this service to everyone for free, making it accessible to all who want to protect their personal data and privacy.<br><br>
                              The <strong>XposedOrNot</strong> platform aids people in discovering whether their email or personal details have been compromised in a data breach. This knowledge can propel users to safeguard their accounts with measures such as password changes and vigilant account monitoring.<br><br>
                              Aside from just checking emails and passwords, the website also facilitates users in scrutinizing data breach information at a <a href ="domain.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>domain or sub-domain level</strong></a>. For those who can confirm their domain ownership, they gain access to a detailed analysis of the data breaches that have affected their users.<br><br>
                              An exciting addition to our suite of tools is the <a href ="dashboard.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>CXO Dashboard</strong></a>. This feature is particularly helpful for companies and corporations managing multiple domains. The CXO Dashboard offers a unified view of data breaches and all associated analytics. This consolidated perspective can significantly simplify the complex task of breach monitoring across various domains, empowering organizations to understand and respond to security incidents more efficiently and effectively.<br><br>
                              I have developed a <a href ="xposed.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>single page repository</strong></a> comprising all the data breaches loaded onto XposedOrNot. This repository is designed to be visually engaging, simplifying the understanding of each breach's unique aspects.For folks who prefer a simple list of rows in a table, you may refer to <a href="breaches.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>breaches page</strong></a>.<br><br>
                              And that's not all - we have also created a useful utility, a <a href ="shield.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Privacy Shield feature</strong></a> for individuals who do not wish to have their emails publicly searched on our platform. This is particularly useful for those who value their privacy and want to protect their data.<br><br>
                              You may wonder why you should choose <strong>XposedOrNot</strong> over other breach monitoring services. The answer lies in our goal to raise awareness about data breaches and provide support to reduce the effects of such breaches. Every bit of help is a light in the darkness, and we aim to add to that illumination.<br><br>
                              Unlike traditional monitoring services that merely inform you of your exposure and the volume of leaked records, XposedOrNot takes an extra step. We give each email a risk score, notify if the password was exposed in plaintext, and provide information on the top breaches where the email was compromised, among other details.<br><Br>
                              Data breaches are classified by industry on our platform, offering an insightful perspective into the most affected sectors. Our aim is to foster transparency and enable individuals to guard against data breaches effectively. <br><br>
                              I've also incorporated an alerting feature that can be activated for individual websites and domains whenever they appear in data breaches. This service is totally free and is beneficial for everyone – from individual email users to corporations seeking to comprehend their users' vulnerability to data breaches better.<br><br>
                              Furthermore, our <a href ="xposed.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>entire data set </strong></a> can be queried and integrated into your custom applications via our <a href ="api_doc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>XposedOrNot API</strong></a>. Detailed instructions on using the XposedOrNot API in your projects can be found on our API playground. Keeping with our ethos of free and open access to data, our API will continue to remain <strong>completely free of charge</strong>. <br><br>
                              Lastly, I'd like to highlight that our application, API, and related files are all <a href ="https://github.com/XposedOrNot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>open source and hosted in GitHub</strong></a>. This open-source approach helps improve the security posture of the platform and invites contributions from the public. I believe in the power of collective wisdom and encourage security enthusiasts, web developers, designers, and data-breach researchers to share their ideas and collaborate to make <strong>XposedOrNot</strong> even more robust,secure and effective. Your <a href ="hof.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>contributions</strong></a> can help further strengthen this free public utility. Let's work together to make XposedOrNot even better!

                              At XposedOrNot, I source most of our exposed data from breaches that are available on the internet. These breaches are typically found on various websites, and with proper searching techniques, can be relatively easy for someone to access. Additionally, I also source some data breaches through Peer-to-Peer (P2P) technologies such as torrents.<br><br>
                              XON only uses data breaches that have been made publicly available. Our goal is to make it easy for individuals and organizations to check whether their personal information has been exposed in any known data breaches, and to take steps to protect themselves against potential harm.

                              XposedOrNot is a data breach monitoring service that allows users to check whether personal information has been exposed in any known data breaches. I want to be transparent with our users about what is and what is not stored in our service.<br><br>
                              To answer that question, we do not store any user passwords or personal identifiable information (PII) in XON. When a user enters their email address or domain name into our search engine, we check our database of known data breaches to see if that email or domain has been involved in any past breaches. If there is a match, we provide the user with information on the specific breach(es) that their email or domain was involved in, along with any additional details we have on the incident.<br><br>
                              We do not store information about user searches, such as the email or domain name searched and the date of the search, and we take measures to ensure the privacy and security of our users' data.<br><br>
                              In summary, XON does not store any user passwords or PII, but we do store some basic information about user searches for the purpose of improving our service. <br><br>                           XON also has the feature of <a href="https://xposedornot.com/password">

                              Usually, it's not a good idea to reveal where data breaches come from because of how much sensitive information is at stake. However, in XON, all the data that's been collected is uploaded and can be easily searched through the website or API for any email you input.

                        <div class="panel-body px-3 mb-4"> <strong>What is the risk score formula? </strong><br> <br>
                           The <strong>risk score formula</strong> calculates a user's account risk based on the number and severity of data breaches associated with the user's email, the time since the last breach, and the strength of the user's password. <br><br>
                           The formula is:<br> 
                           <strong>			   Risk Score = (A x W1) + (B x W2) + (C x W3) + (D x W4)</strong> <br><br>
                           where: <br>
                           A = number of data breaches associated with the user's email address<br>
                           B = severity of data breaches associated with the user's email address<br>
                           C = time since last breach associated with the user's email address<br>
                           D = password strength based on a password strength algorithm<br><br>
                           and:<br><br>
                           W1 = weight for factor A<br>
                           W2 = weight for factor B<br>
                           W3 = weight for factor C<br>
                           W4 = weight for factor D<br><br>
                           For example, let's say we assign the following weights to each factor:<br><br>
                           W1 = 4 (number of data breaches is considered the most important factor)<br>
                           W2 = 2 (severity of data breaches is also important, but not as much as the number of breaches)<br>
                           W3 = 1 (time since last breach is still important, but less so than the other factors)<br>
                           W4 = 3 (password strength is also important, but not as much as the number of breaches)<br><br>
                           We could then use the following formula to calculate a user's risk score:<br><br>
                           Risk Score = (A x 4) + (B x 2) + (C x 1) + (D x 3)<br><br>
                           For example, if a user has been involved in 5 data breaches, with 2 of them being high-severity breaches, and the last breach occurring 6 months ago, and has a strong password, their risk score would be:<br><br>
                           Risk Score = (5 x 4) + (2 x 2) + (6/12 x 1) + (1 x 3) = 31
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>How is the risk score calculated?</strong><br><br>
                           Each factor is multiplied by its weight, and the results are added together to calculate the risk score. The risk score will be displayed visually as a traffic light system, with green indicating low risk, yellow indicating moderate risk, and red indicating high risk.
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>What factors are considered in the risk score formula?</strong>
                           <br><br>
                           The factors considered in the risk score formula are the number and severity of data breaches associated with the user's email, the time since the last breach, and the strength of the user's password.

                           In creating this application and website, I have taken into consideration the impact of unsecured and unsafe environments on data breaches and related exposure. That's why I have made the decision to <strong>open source the API and all related files</strong> on <a href="https://github.com/XposedOrNot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Github</strong></a>. As a long-time user, I firmly believe that open-source tools have had a significant impact on our environment, more than we may ever realize.<br><Br>
                           The entire application and website are built on open source technology, including the operating system (Linux), API script (Python), and web files (HTML/CSS/JavaScript). By collaborating and working together, we can improve and enhance any service, and open source is the way forward.<br><br>
                           I welcome any pull requests and contributions to modify, enhance, or fix any bugs. Let's work together to create a better and more secure online environment for everyone ❤️ .<br>

                           AlertMe is a 💡 handy notification service that sends you an email whenever a new breach is added to XposedOrNot. It's a great way to stay on top of any potential exposure and take the necessary steps to protect yourself. Setting up AlertMe is easy, all you have to do is enter your email and confirm it. From then on, you'll receive an email alert for any new breaches that affect the email address you subscribed with. You can activate AlertMe from the home page or by running a search for exposed data breaches. We'll provide guidance on subscriptions with every search, and you can even activate it through the password search feature.

                           I would love for everyone to contribute to making XON more useful for the general public. Account takeovers and password attacks are a real problem, and any help we can get in that direction is highly appreciated. I strongly believe that every little effort counts in the fight against data breaches, and I welcome anyone who wants to lend a hand.<br><br>
                           If you come across a data breach that is not listed in XON and is publicly accessible without any cost or expectation of remuneration, please do not hesitate to contact me and let me know. I will verify the breach and add it to XON for everyone to benefit from. We even have a special <strong>Hall of Fame</strong> page dedicated to recognizing and thanking individuals who help us in this initiative.<br> <br>
