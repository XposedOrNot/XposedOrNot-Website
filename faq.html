                              Hello, I'm, Devanand Premkumar, and I bring over two
                              decades of experience in IT and information security. My career has been dedicated to
                              helping organizations fortify their online defenses and ensure they comply with industry
                              standards. I'm skilled at crafting and implementing security strategies that work across
                              the globe, whether it's technical or not.
                              <br><br>
                              Outside of work, I have a strong interest in forensic investigations and enjoy tackling
                              challenges in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions. In 2017, I started a side project
                              called XposedOrNot. It began as a way to collect and share exposed passwords for free.
                              Over time, I've been gathering data from public breaches, and now, with a wealth of
                              information at hand, I want to offer this resource to those who can benefit from it the
                              most.<br><br>
                              My journey in IT and information security has been immensely fulfilling, and I'm committed
                              to sharing my knowledge and expertise to create a safer digital world for all.

                              <strong>XposedOrNot (XON)</strong> is a practical and resourceful tool designed to enable
                              you to verify üîç if your personal data has been implicated in a data breach. Originally,
                              this initiative was born out of my deep interest in forensics and the analysis of data
                              breaches. The realization of the sheer volume of sensitive information exposed and the
                              potential harm it could cause quickly led me to transform this interest into a public
                              service. I was motivated to offer this service to everyone for free, making it accessible
                              to all who want to protect their personal data and privacy.<br><br>
                              The <strong>XposedOrNot</strong> platform aids people in discovering whether their email
                              or personal details have been compromised in a data breach. This knowledge can propel
                              users to safeguard their accounts with measures such as password changes and vigilant
                              account monitoring.<br><br>
                              Aside from just checking emails and passwords, the website also facilitates users in
                              scrutinizing data breach information at a <a href="domain.html" target="_blank"
                                 rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>domain or sub-domain level</strong></a>. For those
                              who can confirm their domain ownership, they gain access to a detailed analysis of the
                              data breaches that have affected their users.<br><br>
                              An exciting addition to our suite of tools is the <a href="dashboard.html" target="_blank"
                                 rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>CXO Dashboard</strong></a>. This feature is
                              particularly helpful for companies and corporations managing multiple domains. The CXO
                              Dashboard offers a unified view of data breaches and all associated analytics. This
                              consolidated perspective can significantly simplify the complex task of breach monitoring
                              across various domains, empowering organizations to understand and respond to security
                              incidents more efficiently and effectively.<br><br>
                              <a href="xposed.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Xposed (single
                                    page repository)</strong></a> comprises of details about all the data breaches
                              loaded onto XposedOrNot. This repository is designed to be visually engaging, simplifying
                              the understanding of each breach's unique aspects.For folks who prefer a simple list of
                              rows in a table, you may refer to <a href="breaches.html" target="_blank"
                                 rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>breaches page</strong></a>.<br><br>
                              We have also created a useful utility, a <a href="shield.html" target="_blank"
                                 rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Privacy Shield feature</strong></a> for individuals
                              who do not wish to have their emails publicly searched on our platform. This is
                              particularly useful for those who value their privacy and want to protect their
                              data.<br><br>
                              You may wonder why you should choose <strong>XposedOrNot</strong> over other breach
                              monitoring services. The answer lies in our goal to raise awareness about data breaches
                              and provide support to reduce the effects of such breaches. Every bit of help is a light
                              in the darkness, and we aim to add to that illumination.<br><br>
                              Unlike traditional monitoring services that merely inform you of your exposure and the
                              volume of leaked records, XposedOrNot takes an extra step. We give each email a risk
                              score, notify if the password was exposed in plaintext, and provide information on the top
                              breaches where the email was compromised, among other details.<br><Br>
                              Data breaches are classified by industry on our platform, offering an insightful
                              perspective into the most affected sectors. Our aim is to foster transparency and enable
                              individuals to guard against data breaches effectively. <br><br>
                              I've also incorporated an alerting feature that can be activated for individual websites
                              and domains whenever they appear in data breaches. This service is totally free and is
                              beneficial for everyone ‚Äì from individual email users to corporations seeking to
                              comprehend their users' vulnerability to data breaches better.<br><br>
                              Furthermore, our <a href="xposed.html" target="_blank"
                                 rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>entire data set </strong></a> can be queried and
                              integrated into your custom applications via our <a href="api_doc.html" target="_blank"
                                 rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>XposedOrNot API</strong></a>. Detailed instructions
                              on using the XposedOrNot API in your projects can be found on our API playground. Keeping
                              with our ethos of free and open access to data, our API will continue to remain
                              <strong>completely free of charge</strong>. <br><br>
                              Lastly, I'd like to highlight that our application, API, and related files are all <a

                                 rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>open source and hosted in GitHub</strong></a>. This
                              open-source approach helps improve the security posture of the platform and invites
                              contributions from the public. I believe in the power of collective wisdom and encourage
                              security enthusiasts, web developers, designers, and data-breach researchers to share
                              their ideas and collaborate to make <strong>XposedOrNot</strong> even more robust,secure
                              and effective. Your <a href="hof.html" target="_blank"
                                 rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>contributions</strong></a> can help further

                              At XposedOrNot, I source most of our exposed data from breaches that are available on the
                              internet. These breaches are typically found on various websites, and with proper
                              searching techniques, can be relatively easy for someone to access. Additionally, I also
                              source some data breaches through technologies such as torrents.<br><br>
                              XON only uses data breaches that have been made publicly available. Our goal is to make it
                              easy for individuals and organizations to check whether their personal information has
                              been exposed in any known data breaches, and to take steps to protect themselves against
                              potential harm.

                              XposedOrNot is a data breach monitoring service that allows users to check whether
                              personal information has been exposed in any known data breaches. I want to be transparent
                              with our users about what is and what is not stored in our service.<br><br>
                              To answer that question, we do not store any user passwords or personal identifiable
                              information (PII) in XON. When a user enters their email address or domain name into our
                              search engine, we check our database of known data breaches to see if that email or domain
                              has been involved in any past breaches. If there is a match, we provide the user with
                              information on the specific breach(es) that their email or domain was involved in, along
                              with any additional details we have on the incident.<br><br>
                              We do not store information about user searches, such as the email or domain name searched
                              and the date of the search, and we take measures to ensure the privacy and security of our
                              users' data.<br><br>
                              In summary, XON does not store any user passwords or PII, but we do store some basic
                              information about user searches for the purpose of improving our service. <br><br>XON also
                              has the ability to check <a href="https://xposedornot.com/password"><strong>exposed

                              Usually, it's not a good idea to reveal where data breaches come from because of how much
                              sensitive information is at stake. However, in XON, all the data that's been collected is
                              uploaded and can be easily searched through the website or API for any email you input.

                        <div class="panel-body px-3 mb-4"> <strong>What is the risk score formula? </strong><br> <br>
                           The <strong>risk score formula</strong> calculates a user's account risk based on the number
                           and severity of data breaches associated with the user's email, the time since the last
                           breach, and the strength of the user's password. <br><br>
                           The formula is:<br>
                           <strong> Risk Score = (A x W1) + (B x W2) + (C x W3) + (D x W4)</strong> <br><br>
                           where: <br>
                           A = number of data breaches associated with the user's email address<br>
                           B = severity of data breaches associated with the user's email address<br>
                           C = time since last breach associated with the user's email address<br>
                           D = password strength based on a password strength algorithm<br><br>
                           and:<br><br>
                           W1 = weight for factor A<br>
                           W2 = weight for factor B<br>
                           W3 = weight for factor C<br>
                           W4 = weight for factor D<br><br>
                           For example, let's say we assign the following weights to each factor:<br><br>
                           W1 = 4 (number of data breaches is considered the most important factor)<br>
                           W2 = 2 (severity of data breaches is also important, but not as much as the number of
                           breaches)<br>
                           W3 = 1 (time since last breach is still important, but less so than the other factors)<br>
                           W4 = 3 (password strength is also important, but not as much as the number of
                           breaches)<br><br>
                           We could then use the following formula to calculate a user's risk score:<br><br>
                           Risk Score = (A x 4) + (B x 2) + (C x 1) + (D x 3)<br><br>
                           For example, if a user has been involved in 5 data breaches, with 2 of them being
                           high-severity breaches, and the last breach occurring 6 months ago, and has a strong
                           password, their risk score would be:<br><br>
                           Risk Score = (5 x 4) + (2 x 2) + (6/12 x 1) + (1 x 3) = 31
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>How is the risk score calculated?</strong><br><br>
                           Each factor is multiplied by its weight, and the results are added together to calculate the
                           risk score. The risk score will be displayed visually as a traffic light system, with green
                           indicating low risk, yellow indicating moderate risk, and red indicating high risk.
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>What factors are considered in the risk score formula?</strong>
                           <br><br>
                           The factors considered in the risk score formula are the number and severity of data breaches
                           associated with the user's email, the time since the last breach, and the strength of the
                           user's password.

                           Account takeovers and password attacks are a real problem, and any help we can get in that
                           direction is highly appreciated. I strongly believe that every little effort counts in the

                           If you come across a data breach that is not listed in XON and is publicly accessible without
                           any cost or expectation of remuneration, please do not hesitate to contact me and let me
                           know. I will verify the breach and add it to XON for everyone to benefit from. We even have a
