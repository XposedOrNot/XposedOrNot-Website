                  Thank you for your interest in <strong>XposedOrNot</strong>. The goal is to keep our API as accessible
                  and responsive as possible, making it a valuable tool for everyone. Hosted directly on <strong>Google
                     Infrastructure</strong> and robustly cached by <strong>Cloudflare</strong>, the <strong>XposedOrNot
                     API</strong> offers rapid responses for any queries, regardless of their origin point. <br><Br>
                  The <strong>XposedOrNot API</strong> adheres to the principles of <strong>REST architecture</strong>.
                  It returns <strong>JSON-encoded responses</strong> and utilizes <strong>standard HTTP response
                     codes</strong>. For the majority of our API routes, there are no authentication requirements,
                  ensuring easy access and simplicity of use. However, please note that our specific <strong>API route
                     used for querying domain-related data requires an API key authorization</strong>. This measure is
                  in place to ensure that only verified owners or authorities of the specified domains can access this
                  sensitive information.<br><br>
                  For experimentation and testing purposes, I warmly invite you to explore our API Playground. Here,
                  you'll have the opportunity to familiarize yourself with the functionality of the XposedOrNot API in a
                  user-friendly environment.

                        <strong>1. API Call: Checking for Email Address Data Breaches</strong>
                     </h4>
                  </div>
                  <p>
                     This user-friendly API quickly checks if an email address has been involved in any known data
                     breaches. It searches a comprehensive database of breaches and alerts you if the email is at risk.
                     <br><br>
                     This tool is invaluable for maintaining digital security and understanding the breach history of an
                     email. It's a step towards better digital safety and awareness.
                  </p>

                  </blockquote>
                  <strong> Example of Successful Breach Detection: </strong>
                  When a breach is detected, you'll receive a JSON response like this:
                  <pre>
 {
  "breaches": [
    [
      "Tesco",
      "KiwiFarms",
      "Vermillion",
      "Verified",
      "LizardSquad",
      "2fast4u",
      "Autotrader",
      "MyRepoSpace",
      "SweClockers"
    ]
  ]
}
		  </pre>
                  The response is in JSON format, making it simple to parse with any scripting language. This lets you
                  easily integrate the data into your applications.
                  <br> <strong>Response When No Breach is Found:</strong><br>
                  If the email address is not found in any breach database, you will get the following JSON response:
                  <pre>
{"Error":"Not found"}

                     Our API offers an in-depth analysis of an email address's data breach history. It reveals when and
                     where breaches occurred, providing essential analytics to gauge the impact and severity of these
                     incidents. This tool is key for understanding data exposure levels and enhancing security
                     strategies.

                  <p>If you're interested in checking for exposed passwords, this API is perfect for you. It provides
                     results in two forms: successful or unsuccessful. Imagine you want to check the widely used
                     password "123456" - this API can help.</p>

                  <p>The API delivers results in a JSON format, which is more informative than a simple yes/no. This
                     detailed output enables further analysis and enhancement of the extensive list of real-time exposed

                  XposedOrNot API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API
                  request. In general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error
                  that failed given the information provided (e.g., wrong parameters, insufficient query options, wrong
                  url etc). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with XposedOrNot's server. <br>
                  <br> In other words, codes in the 4xx range indicate an user error(You) and 5xx indicates a server
                  error(Me). <br>
